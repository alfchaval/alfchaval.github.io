This is a somewhat high number of points, but it allows for an exact distribution, avoiding decimals.	<br>	- Players receive points as soon as they leave the game, allowing them to immediately know how many points they have earned. Players who were playing when the round time ends are considered to have left the game at that same time.	<br>	- Players receive points based on their position and how many players left the game at the same time as them.	<h2>How to calculate your points</h2>	The formula for obtaining the total points earned by a player is 6 * (2M - P - J) / (M - 1)	<br>	M = total number of players at the table.	<br>	J = how many players were still playing before you lost	<br>	P = your position in the game	<br>	<br>	For example, if at a 4-player table, 3 players lose at the same time and you want to calculate the points for each of these 3 players:	<br>	J = 4, since they lost when 4 of them were still playing.	<br>	P = 2, since only one person finished ahead of them.	<br>	Points earned for each of these three players = 6 * (2 * 4 - 2 - 4) / (4 - 1) = 4 points.	<h2>Points tables</h2>	<table>        <caption>4-Players Table</caption>        <tr>            <th>Players leaving the game</th>            <th>Points obtained by each one</th>        </tr>        <tr><td>4</td><td>6, 6, 6, 6</td></tr>        <tr><td>3 -> 1</td><td>4, 4, 4, 12</td></tr>        <tr><td>2 -> 2</td><td>2, 2, 10, 10</td></tr>        <tr><td>2 -> 1 -> 1</td><td>2, 2, 8, 12</td></tr>        <tr><td>1 -> 3</td><td>0, 8, 8, 8</td></tr>        <tr><td>1 -> 2 -> 1</td><td>0, 6, 6, 12</td></tr>        <tr><td>1 -> 1 -> 2</td><td>0, 4, 10, 10</td></tr>        <tr><td>1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1</td><td>0, 4, 8, 12</td></tr>    </table>    <table>        <caption>3-Players Table</caption>        <tr>            <th>Players leaving the game/th>            <th>Points obtained by each one</th>        </tr>        <tr><td>3</td><td>6, 6, 6</td></tr>        <tr><td>2 -> 1</td><td>3, 3, 12</td></tr>        <tr><td>1 -> 2</td><td>0, 9, 9</td></tr>        <tr><td>1 -> 1 -> 1</td><td>0, 6, 12</td></tr>    </table></html>
